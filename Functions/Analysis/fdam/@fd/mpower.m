function powerfd = mpower(fdobj, m)
%  A positive integer power of a functional data object with a B-spline
%  basis.
%  Power M is tested for being a positive integer, and, if not, 
%  an error message is issued.  
%  The basis is tested for being a B-spline basis.
%  If M and the basis of FDOBj pass these tests, then  the function
%  sets up a new spline basis with the same knots but with an order
%  that is M-1 higher than the basis for FDOBJ, so that the 
%  order of differentiability for the new basis is appropriate.
%  The power of the values of the function over a fine mesh are computed,
%  and these are fit using the new basis.
%
%  Powers should be requested with caution, however.  If there is
%  strong local curvature in FDOBJ, and if its basis is just barely
%  adequate to capture this curvature, then this function may introduce
%  considerable error into the values of the power over this local area.
%
%  If a power of a functional data object is required for which the
%  basis is not a spline, it is better to either re-represent the
%  function in a spline basis, or, perhaps even better, to do the 
%  math required to get the right basis and interpolate function
%  values over a suitable mesh.  This is especially true for fourier
%  bases.
