function basisobj = create_TP_basis(basisobj1, basisobj2)
%  CREATE_TP_BASIS sets up a tensor product basis for the analysis
%  of two-dimensional spatial data or of time crossed with one-dimensional 
%  data.  It constructs this basis from two one-dimensional basis objects.
%
%  Arguments:
%  BASISOBJ1 ... A one-dimensional functional basis object.
%  BASISOBJ2 ... A one-dimensional functional basis object.
%  
%  Returns:
%  An object of the basis class with parameters stored in member PARAMS.
%  In this case the member PARAMS is a struct object with members
%  BASISOBJ1 and BASISOBJ2.  The RANGEVAL object is a 2 by 2 matrix with
%  the first row containing the lower and upper range values for object
%  BASISOBJ1 and the second row the same for BASISOBJ2.   Similarly,
%  the NBASIS member is a vector of length 2 containing the two numbers
%  of basis functions.   The TYPE member is 'TP'.

%  Functional data objects are defined
