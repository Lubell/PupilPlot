Use this menu option to import new eye-tracking files.

File types supported:
<ul><li dir="ltr">SMI .txt files that have been exported from the SMI .idf format using SMI's eye tools
</li><li dir="ltr">Tobii .tsv files</li></ul>

Steps:
1) After selecting the "New eye tracking files" option under the <a style="color:#204A87" href="Load.html">Load</a> menu, a selection pop-up window will open.
2) Navigate to the folder that contains the raw/new files and select all the files you want to import using shift.*
3) After selecting the files for import, another selection pop-up window will open.  This pop-up is used to select a directory (or make a new one) that will hold the imported files and be the main working directory for the rest of the analysis and preprocessing.**
3) The status of the import will be shown in the MATLAB command window and the Graph: title will change to reflect this as well.

After successful file loading the <a style="color:#204A87" href="Preprocess.html">Preprocess</a> menu will be enabled.

Notes:
The import functions are largely built on a standardized format that exported eye-tracking files currently have.  If the format changes the functions will break.  To make the function more robust keywords could be defined for the columns you want to import.  These keywords would have to be in a preferences.


* Imported files will have the extension .mat and will also have _IMP stuck on the end.  Ex: RawFile_1.txt will become RawFile_1_IMP.mat
** It is highly recommended that users use a different directory than the one that contains the raw files.
