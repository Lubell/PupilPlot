# PupilPlot - a command line and graphical user interface pupil analysis tool

![Welcome PupilPlot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Lubell/PupilPlot/master/Functions/GUI/HelpGui/pupilplot%20documentation/Pages/welcomePupilPlot.png) 

Within the PupilPlot files and functions there is help text that is located [here](https://github.com/Lubell/PupilPlot/tree/master/Functions/GUI/HelpGui/pupilplot%20documentation).
By downloading only that folder you can read about the functions in PupilPlot and therein you will also find a simple walkthrough.

## Install
To install PupilPlot on your local computer you can either 
- initialize a new git folder and clone the project to that folder
- or download the zip file and unpack it somewhere that you'll remember

## Run
To run the PupilPlot GUI navigate to the unzipped folder and from the MATLAB command line type:

```sh
>> start_PupilPlotGUI
```

to just add all of the correct paths for PupilPlot and skip the visual interface type:

```sh
>> start_PupilPlotGUI('nogui')
```
