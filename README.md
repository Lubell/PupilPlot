# PupilPlot - a command line and graphical user interface pupil analysis tool

![Welcome PupilPlot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Lubell/PupilPlot/master/Functions/GUI/HelpGui/pupilplot%20documentation/Pages/welcomePupilPlot.png) 

Within the PupilPlot files and functions there is help text that is located [here](https://github.com/Lubell/PupilPlot/tree/master/Functions/GUI/HelpGui/pupilplot%20documentation).
By downloading only that folder you can read about the functions in PupilPlot and therein you will also find a simple walkthrough.

## Install
To install PupilPlot on your local computer you can either 
- initialize a new git folder and clone the project to that folder
- or download the zip file and unpack it somewhere that you'll remember

## Run
To run the PupilPlot GUI navigate to the unzipped folder and from the MATLAB command line type:

```sh
>> start_PupilPlotGUI
```

to just add all of the correct paths for PupilPlot and skip the visual interface type:

```sh
>> start_PupilPlotGUI('nogui')
```
## Info
PupilPlot is very much still a work in progress and should be treated as such.  Please let me know if there are any bugs etc. and I'll be happy to talk to you about it and figure out what is going on.
As is usual this work strongly relies on code that was not originally mine own and the references contain (and most likely omit) the people truly responsible for enabling PupilPlot.

I'm a researcher and engineer at UiO and collaborate with UCB.  Let me know if you want to help out or are disgusted with what you find.
